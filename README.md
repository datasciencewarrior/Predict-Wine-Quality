# Predict-Wine-Quality
My first project
This is my first time to create and upload a project in github. 

The project main purpose is to explore the data and analyze which element predicts the wine quality. The dataset has combined both red and white wine dataset from Kaggle. 

Findings
Both red and white wines have a majority of wine quaility between 5 and 6. It is found that alcohol level has a positive relationship with quailty of both red and white wine. In terms of density, white wine has a higher negative relationship between density and quality of wine. Whereas for red wine, the higher the quality of red wine, the lower is the volatile acidity. 

Conclusion
The project mainly analyzes the elements in regards to correlation between wine quality and other factors. The project assumes that wine quality is the dependent variable whilte other factors are the independent variables. All in all, density, alochol and acidity are affecting the wine quality.
